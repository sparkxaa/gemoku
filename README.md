# Gomoku · Play Against AI, Real Challenge

> A game of Gomoku on your phone. Your opponent is the AI. No internet needed—start anytime.

---

## What Is This?

**Gomoku** is a single-player board game on your phone. You don’t need a friend or a connection—just open the app and play against the AI. The rules are the ones you know: Black moves first, then White. The first to get five in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.

Perfect for when you want to think a bit without going all-in—commute, waiting around, or before bed. One quick game is enough.

## Why Play?

### No Internet, Play Anywhere

The AI runs entirely on your device. Subway, plane, poor signal—you can still play. After you move, the AI responds quickly. No long waits.

### Strong AI, Real Challenge

The AI runs at a high level locally. It plays with a clear strategy, so it’s good if you want to practice seriously. Winning feels rewarding, and you can also try to win in fewer moves.

### Choose Black or White

Before each game you can choose **Black** (first move) or **White** (second move). Practice attacking with the first move or defending with the second—your choice.

### Challenge: Win in Fewer Moves

Besides winning, the game tracks **how many moves** it took you to win. Try to beat your own best and set a new record. One more goal to aim for.

### English and 中文

You can switch the language in Settings. Both English and Chinese are supported.

## How to Play

1. Open the app and tap **“Start vs AI”**.
2. Choose **Black** or **White**, then start the game.
3. When it’s your turn, tap the intersection where you want to place your stone. When it’s the AI’s turn, it will move automatically (you may see “AI thinking…”).
4. The first to get five in a row wins. If you’re sure you’ll lose, you can tap **“Resign”** to end the game.
5. When the game ends, choose **“Again”** for another game or **“Back”** to return to the main menu.

In **Settings** (gear icon, top right) you can:
- Turn sound and vibration on or off
- View About and version info

## Who Is It For?

## Coming Next

Future versions will upgrade to a **neural network**–based AI: smarter and more “thinking” as an opponent, still running fully on your device with no internet required. Stay tuned.
